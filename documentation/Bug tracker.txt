*** BUGS!! ***

CRITICAL - Regression - user unable to create a new order.
MAJOR - Regression - user unable to update a courier.
MAJOR - Regression - user unable to update an order.
MAJOR - Regression - user unable to update a product.

MAJOR - Auto-generated order date/time values are in a different format to those in the database. Will cause errors when trying to add orders to the db table. Need to fix!

MINOR - When printing tables, ugly error details are displayed in terminal if app cannot connect to the db/access the db table.
Need to add try-except block to the 'print_db_table(item_type)' function.

MINOR - When the user attemps to add a new product/courier and the app is unable to connect to the db/access a db table, the user gets an error message printed above the app menu.
There should be a 'Enter to continue...' message with a clean return to the app menu.

TRIVIAL - User is presented with two error messages when the app is unable to query a db table during the order create/update journey.
The second error message states that the app was unable to connect to the db, which is incorrect. (Think the bug is in the nested try except blocks.)
