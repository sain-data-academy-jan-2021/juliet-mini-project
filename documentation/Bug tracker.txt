*** BUG FIXES ***

[FIXED] CRITICAL - Regression - user unable to add a new product to the db table.
[FIXED] CRITICAL - Regression - user unable to update the status of an order.
[FIXED] CRITICAL - Regression - user unable to create a new order.

[FIXED] MAJOR - Regression - user unable to delete a courier.
[FIXED] MAJOR - Regression - user unable to delete a product.
[FIXED] MAJOR - Regression - user unable to delete an order.
[FIXED] MAJOR - When the user attempts to create or update an order and the app is unable to connect to the db/access a db table, the user is not immediately returned to app menu.
Instead, the create/update process continues pointlessly.
[FIXED] MAJOR - Auto-generated order date/time values are in a different format to those in the database. Will cause errors when trying to add orders to the db table. Need to fix!
[FIXED] MAJOR - Regression - user unable to update a courier.
[FIXED] MAJOR - Regression - user unable to update a product.
[FIXED] MAJOR - Regression - user unable to update an order.
[FIXED] MAJOR - User unable to delete a product selection from an existing order.

[FIXED] MINOR - Table of orders is not printed to the terminal during the order status update journey.
[FIXED] MINOR - When the user attemps to add a new product/courier and the app is unable to connect to the db/access a db table, the user gets an error message printed above the app menu.
There should be a 'Enter to continue...' message with a clean return to the app menu.
[FIXED] MINOR - Newly created orders have a varchar value of NULL rather than actual NULL in the products columns of the db table.
[FIXED] MINOR - When printing tables from the 'view' option, ugly error details are displayed in terminal if app cannot connect to the db/access the db table.

[FIXED] TRIVIAL - User is presented with two error messages when the app is unable to query a db table during the order create/update journey.
The second error message states that the app was unable to connect to the db, which is incorrect. (Think the bug is in the nested try except blocks.)


*** FEATURES WISH LIST ***

[DONE] Combine all products into one db table with a product type category.

[BACKLOG] Sort items in products table by product type after new item is added? (Would ids change?)
[BACKLOG] Split out ordered products into a separate table? (probably big piece of work)
[BACKLOG] Calculate total cost for orders? (probably big piece of work)
[BACKLOG] Create custom error type for db functions?
