*** BUGS ***

[FIXED] MAJOR - When the user attempts to create or update an order and the app is unable to connect to the db/access a db table, the user is not immediately returned to app menu.
Instead, the create/update process continues.

CRITICAL - Add, update and delete functionality for products, couriers & orders currently broken!!

MAJOR - Auto-generated order date/time values are in a different format to those in the database. Will cause errors when trying to add orders to the db table. Need to fix!

MINOR - When printing tables, ugly error details are displayed in terminal if app cannot connect to the db/access the db table.
Need to add try-except block to the 'print_db_table(item_type)' function.

TRIVIAL - When the user attemps to add a new product/courier and the app is unable to connect to the db/access a db table, the user gets an error message printed above the app menu.
There should be a 'Enter to continue...' message with a clean return to the app menu.

TRIVIAL - User is presented with two error messages when the app is unable to query a db table during the order create/update journey.
The second error message states that the app was unable to connect to the db, which is incorrect. (Think the bug is in the nested try except blocks.)



*** FEATURES WISH LIST ***

[DONE] MAJOR - Combine all products into one db table with a product type category.
MINOR - Table of orders is not printed to the terminal during the order status update journey.
TRIVIAL - create custom error type for db functions?
TRIVIAL - calculate total cost for orders? (Big piece of work)
